Postmortem: E-commerce Checkout Slowdown (Incident #2024-06-14)
Issue Summary
Duration: 30 minutes (14:00 PST - 14:30 PST) on June 14, 2024.
Impact: Slow checkout process for all users (100% impact). Users experienced delays of up to 2 minutes during the checkout process. No abandoned carts were observed, but customer satisfaction metrics might be negatively affected.
Root Cause: Database connection pool exhaustion due to a recent database query optimization oversight.
Timeline
14:00 PST: Monitoring alerts triggered indicating a significant increase in database response times specifically impacting the checkout process.
14:01 PST: On-call engineer investigates the alert and confirms slow checkout times. Initial suspicion falls on potential network issues.
14:05 PST - 14:15 PST: Investigation into network health confirms no abnormalities. Engineer begins investigating the application server logs for potential bottlenecks.
14:15 PST - 14:20 PST: Reviewing application logs reveals a surge in database connection requests coinciding with the slowdown. The engineer explores the possibility of a database issue.
14:20 PST: The engineer establishes communication with the database administrator to investigate the database load.
14:25 PST: The database administrator identifies a recent database query optimization applied to the checkout process as a potential culprit.
14:25 PST - 14:30 PST: The database administrator disables the recent query optimization, and database connection requests return to normal levels. Checkout process resumes normal operation.
Root Cause & Resolution
The root cause of the issue was a recently deployed database query optimization for the checkout process. While intended to improve efficiency, the optimization resulted in unintended consequences. The optimized query caused a surge in database connection requests, overwhelming the connection pool and leading to slow response times.
The resolution involved disabling the recently deployed query optimization. This immediately restored normal operation to the checkout process.
Corrective & Preventative Measures
Review Database Query Optimizations: A more thorough code review process will be implemented for future database query optimizations. This will involve testing the impact of optimizations on the connection pool before deployment.
Database Connection Pool Monitoring: Monitoring for database connection pool health will be implemented. This will provide early warnings of potential exhaustion scenarios.
Automated Rollback Procedures: Investigate the feasibility of implementing automated rollback procedures for database schema changes that could negatively impact performance.
